  - Add method to print string type variable
  - Compile your code
  - Create a instance of your Class "HelloWorld" with " new HelloWorld()"
  - Run the code
- Command line Build and run the HelloWorld  
  - Crate a static main method in the HelloWorld Class
  - Run Java in command line:
    ` java HelloWorld.java`
