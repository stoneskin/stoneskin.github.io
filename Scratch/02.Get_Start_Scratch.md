# [Lesson 2] Get Start Scratch

## 2.1 About Scratch

Scratch is an online coding language and development environment that allows users to create interactive stories, games, animations, and multimedia projects. It is a free and open-source software that runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

### 2.1.1 Learn Scratch

- To learn what is scratch, please view:  [Introduce scratch](01.Introduce_Scratch.md)
- If you have no experience of Scratch, please start from[Get start of scratch tutorial](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all)
- More scratch tutorial on ["Collection of Coding Cards"](https://resources.scratch.mit.edu/www/cards/en/scratch-cards-all.pdf)

### 2.1.2 Scratch practices

10 blocks will help you to start with scratch. You can view the pdf file and practice it.

- [10 blocks](./2.10blocks.pdf)

## 2.2 Control and condition

In Scratch, control and condition are used to make the program to make decision or to repeat the same action multiple times.

### 2.2.1 Loop


- [repeat](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Repeat_()_(block))
  - when you need do the same actions multiple times
   ![repeat](02.01_repeat.png)

- [forever](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Forever_(block))
  - when you want repeat do something endless
   ![forever](02.01_forever.png)
  - use wait to slow down the loop
  - use 'say' or 'think' block to display the loop

### 2.2.2 Condition

- [if then](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/If_()_Then_(block))
  ![](02.02_if_then.png)
  
- [if then else](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/If_()_Then,_Else_(block))
  ![](02.02_if_then_else.png)

- condition loop : [repeat until](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Repeat_Until_()_(block))
  ![](02.02_repeat_until.png)

- use "[wait until](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Wait_Until_()_(block))" to pause the forever with condition

- stop the forever loop

### 2.2.3 Practice Loop and Condition

Let's practice using loops and conditions in Scratch to make the Cat sprite do fun things!

#### Practice Task

- **Spinning Cat**: When you press the mouse key, the Cat on the stage will keep spinning.
- **Changing Costumes**: When you release the mouse key, the Cat will show a new costume every 1 second.

#### How to Do It

1. **Spinning Cat**:
   - Drag an "if" block into the scripting area.
   - Inside the "if" block, add a "mouse down?" block to check if the mouse key is pressed.
   - Add a "forever" block and put a "turn 15 degrees" block inside it.
   - This will make the Cat spin continuously when the mouse key is pressed.

2. **Changing Costumes**:
   - Drag another "if" block into the scripting area.
   - Inside this "if" block, add a "mouse up?" block to check if the mouse key is released.
   - Add a "wait 1 second" block and a "next costume" block inside the "if" block.
   - This will make the Cat show a new costume every second when the mouse key is released.

## 2.3 Animation in Scratch

### 2.3.1 Animation with Sprite from Library

- **Sprite: Next Costume**:
  - Drag a "next costume" block into the scripting area.
  - Change the sprite's costume to create simple animations.
    ![sprite](02.03.1_sprite.png)

- **FPS: Frame per Second**:
  - Scratch can show up to 30 frames per second (FPS).
  - Use this code to find out the FPS of Scratch:
  ![FPS](02.03.1_FPS.png)


  
### 2.3.2 Drawing your costume

  - **Draw Your Own Costume**:
  ![draw](02.03.2_Drawing.png)
  - Use the drawing tools in Scratch to create your own costumes.

- **Convert Between Vector and Bitmap**:
  - Bitmaps and vectors are two different types of graphics.
  ![vector_bitmap](02.03.2_vector_bitmap.png)
  - **Vector Graphics**: Use mathematical formulas to draw lines and curves.
  ![vector](02.03.2_vector.png)
  - **Bitmap Graphics**: Store the color of each pixel.
  ![bitmap](02.03.2_bitmap.png)

- the different of Vector and Bitmap

### 2.3.3 Animation with code

- **Moving by change location**
  - Use code to move your sprite around the stage.
  
  ![move](02.03.3_AnimationChangeLocation.png)

- **Turn around**
  - Make your sprite turn in different directions.

  ![turn](02.03.3_AnimationTurnAround.png)

- Glide
  - Make your sprite move smoothly.
  
  ![glide](02.03.3_AnimationGlide.png)

- Change color and other graphic effect
  - Use code to change the color and other graphic effect of your sprite.
  
  ![graphic](02.03.3_AnimationChangeGraphic.png)

- Change size
  - Use code to change the size of your sprite.

## 2.4 Scratch practices  and project

### 2.4.1 Practices

- Simple animation in sprit [Build A Band](./3.1.buildABand_v2.pdf)
- Animation with Drawing [Orange Square Purple Circle](3.2.OrangeSquarePurpleCircle_v2.pdf)
- Animation [It's alive](3.3.ItisAlive_v2.pdf)
- Animation with music [Music video](3.4.MusicVideo_v2.pdf)

### 2.4.1 Project of this class

- Base on the  [about me](./2.3AboutMe.pdf)
- Build a Scratch project to introduce yourself.
- Make sure need use all different types of Animation in scratch
- Make sure use Condition and loop in you project
