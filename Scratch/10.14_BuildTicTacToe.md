# 10.13 Build a TicTacToe Game

**Tic‐Tac‐Toe** is a very simple two players game.  So only two players can play at a time. Or you could build one player play with computer.

This game is also known as Noughts and Crosses or **X**s and **O**s game. One player plays with X and
the other player plays with O. In this game we have a board consisting of a 3X3 grid.

## 11.1 Design the Game

### 1. Figure out the rules of Tic Tac Toe Game

1. Two plays control the keyboard in ture
2. The game board is 3X3 grid
3. The player who first get 3 dot in one row will win

### 2. Design the Game UI

1. Game Start, Game Over
2. Board, back ground
3. Chess: Nothing, X, O
4. User input position: n or (x,y)
   ex. position of 2nd column and 3rd row
    - Option 1: 8 (position #8 of total positions)
    - Option 2: (x,y)

### 3. Design the Game Data Structure

1. Option 1: Use List of object with value 0/1 for each position

   ```python
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
   ```

2. Option 2: User 3 Array

      ```python
         Row1  [0,0,0]
         Row2  [0,0,0]
         Row3  [0,0,0]
      ```

### 4. Design the Logic to decide who won the game

1. for Option 1, need check all below possibility

   ```python
    Row[1]=Row[2]=Row[3] or Row[4]=Row[5]=Row[6] or Row[7]=Row[8]=Row[9]
    Row[1]=Row[4]=Row[6] or Row[2]=Row[5]=Row[8 ]or Row[3]=Row[6]=Row[9]
    Row[1]=Row[5]=Row[9] or Row[3]=Row[5]=Row[6]
   ```

2. for Option 2, check below

   ```python
    Row1[1]=Row1[2]=Row1[3] or Row2[1]=Row2[2]=Row2[3] or Row3[1]=Row3[2]=Row3[3]
    Row1[1]=Row2[1]=Row3[1] or Row1[2]=Row2[2]=Row3[2] or Row1[3]=Row2[3]=Row3[3]
    Row1[1]=Row2[2]=Row3[3]  or Row1[3]=Row2[2]=Row3[1]
   ```

## 11.2 Implementation Plan

 1. Load the UI object/Image
 2. Add the code for UI interactive
 3. Add the code for Data Structure
 4. Add the code for winning Judgment Logic

## Challenge

1. Change the one of the player to AI
2. Coding the Logic of the AI player to find the best place to put.
