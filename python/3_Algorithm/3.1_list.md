## 3.1 List

**Lists** are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are **Tuple**, **Set**, and **Dictionary**, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are created using square brackets:

```python
    mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
