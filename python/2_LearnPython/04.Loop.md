# 4 Loop

## 4.1 What is Loop

when you coding, many times you need repeat to do same or similar things again and again.
![copypatest](04.1_copypaste.png)
You could use copy and paste to repeat the code.
![repeat](04.1_repeate.png)

But that's bad code example, because you could you loop and tell computer how many time you need repeat.

## 4.2 For Loop

### 4.2.1 Print "Hello World" 100 times

Below is the example to print "Hello World" 100 time.

```python
for x in range(100):
    print("Hello World!")
```

### 4.2.2 Use the variable in for loop

The variable `x` could be print with `str(x)`.

```python
for x in range(100):
    print("Hello World!" +str(x))
```
![X](04.2_forloop_variable.png)
In python, the x is start fom 0, and end with 99 in this example

![x](04.2_x.png)

### 4.2.3 Example: Draw 4 Circles

To draw 4 circles like below

![draw circles](04.2.3_drawcircles.png)

Below code will draw the 4 circles:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Pen()

for x in range(4):
    t.circle(100)
    t.left(90)

```

### 4.2.4 Practice, draw 6  circles

- Please do it yourself, modify the code in 4.2.3 and change it to draw below 6 circles

![draw circles](04.2.4_drawcircles.png)

- Please try to use the `x` variable to draw 6 circle like below
![draw circles with variable](04.2.4_drawCircleswithVariableChange.png)

### 4.2.5 Advance, change variable with User input

Please practice below code, to see how to let user input the value.

```python
import turtle, time
t = turtle.Pen()
t.speed(10)

# Ask the user for the number of circles in their rosette, default to 20
number_of_circles = int(turtle.numinput("Number of circles", "How many circles in your rosette?", 20))

for x in range(number_of_circles):
    t.circle(100)
    t.left(360/number_of_circles)

time.sleep(10)

```

![result](04.2.5_circles.png)

## 4.3 While Loop

### 4.3.1 While loop syntax

A **while** loop statement is Python repeatedly executes  a target statement as long as the given condition is true.

```python
while expression:
    statement(s)
```

Flow Diagram:
![diagram](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/python_while_loop.jpg)

Example:

```python
i = 1
while i < 10 :
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

### 4.3.2 Try it: Ues `While` loop to Repeat Asking and Print your name

Please try below code yourself

![04.3.2](04.3.2_code.png)

The upper code will keep asking your name until you press enter without give any value.

## 4.4 Break statement of loop

Wile the `break` statement , you could stop the loop event if the while condition is true.

### 4.4.1 Break statement `For` loop example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break

```

### 4.4.2 Break statement `While` loop example:

```python
i = 1
while True:
    print(i)
    i += 1
    if( i>10 ):
        break
```

## 4.5 Continue Statement

Use Continue statement will skip the remain lines of code and to next loop

### 4.5.1 `Continue` statement `For` loop example:

The print "banana" will be skip in below code.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)
```

### 4.5.2 `Continue` statement `While` loop example:

The number 3 will not be print by below code.

```python
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
```

## 4.6 Double loop

If you never try put a loop inside a loop, you need try it.

![doubleloop](04.6_double_loop.png)

```python
import turtle,time
t = turtle.Pen()
t.speed(30)
for x in range(12):
    for y in range(4):
        t.circle(10)
        t.left(90)
    t.forward(50)
    t.left(30)

time.sleep(10)

```

## 4.7 Loop practice

### 4.7.1 Use `while` and `for` loop , input and turtle together

```python
# SpiralFamily.py - prints a colorful spiral of names
import turtle     # Set up turtle graphics
t = turtle.Pen()  
turtle.bgcolor("black")
colors = ["red", "yellow", "blue", "green", "orange",  "purple", "white", "brown", "gray", "pink" ]
family = []       # Set up an empty list for family names

# Ask for the first name
name = turtle.textinput("My family","Enter a name, or just hit [ENTER] to end:")

# Keep asking for names
while name != "":
    # Add their name to the family list
    family.append(name)
    # Ask for another name, or end
    name = turtle.textinput("My family","Enter a name, or just hit [ENTER] to end:")

# Draw a spiral of the names on the screen
for x in range(100):
    t.pencolor(colors[x%len(family)]) # Rotate through the colors
    t.penup()                         # Don't draw the regular spiral lines
    t.forward(x*4)                    # Just move the turtle on the screen
    t.pendown()                       # Draw the next family member's name
    t.write(family[x%len(family)], font = ("Arial", int((x+4)/4), "bold") )
    t.left(360/len(family) + 2)         # Turn left for our spiral

```

You will got a image like below

### 4.7.2 Challenge

Could you modify the upper code to make a picture like below?
![04.7.1](04.7.1_challenge.png)

hint:

- Change the previous script to change user input value to draw circle
- Modify your script to change color
- Modify your script to draw spiral of circles
- No need exactly same just need get similar pattern
