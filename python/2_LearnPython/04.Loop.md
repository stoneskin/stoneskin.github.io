# 4 Loop

## 4.1 What is Loop

when you coding, many times you need repeat to do same or similar things again and again.
![copypatest](04.1_copypaste.png)
You could use copy and paste to repeat the code.
![repeat](04.1_repeate.png)

But that's bad code example, because you could you loop and tell computer how many time you need repeat.

## 4.2 For Loop

### 4.2.1 Print "Hello World" 100 times

Below is the example to print "Hello World" 100 time.

```python
for x in range(100):
    print("Hello World!")
```

### 4.2.2 Use the variable in for loop

The variable `x` could be print with `str(x)`.

```python
for x in range(100):
    print("Hello World!" +str(x))
```
![X](04.2_forloop_variable.png)
In python, the x is start fom 0, and end with 99 in this example

### 4.2.3 Example: Draw 4 Circles

To draw 4 circles like below

![draw circles](04.2.3_drawcircles.png)

Below code will draw the 4 circles:

```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Pen()

for x in range(4):
    t.circle(100)
    t.left(90)

```

### 4.2.4 Practice, draw 6  circles

- Please do it yourself, modify the code in 4.2.3 and change it to draw below 6 circles

![draw circles](04.2.4_drawcircles.png)

- Please try to use the `x` variable to draw 6 circle like below

### 4.2.5 Advance, change variable with User input

Please practice below code, to see how to let user input the value.

```python
import turtle, time
t = turtle.Pen()
t.speed(10)

# Ask the user for the number of circles in their rosette, default to 20
number_of_circles = int(turtle.numinput("Number of circles", "How many circles in your rosette?", 20))

for x in range(number_of_circles):
    t.circle(100)
    t.left(360/number_of_circles)

time.sleep(10)

```
