# 09 Python OOP

Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects.

## 9.1 4 principles of OOP

There are 4 major principles that make an language Object Oriented. These are Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance. These are also called as four pillars of Object Oriented Programming.

![4 principles](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*GDZKZyaSfQGm8HL-CtYWtA.jpeg)

### 9.1.1 Encapsulation

Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private, inside a class. Other objects don’t have direct access to this state. Instead, they can only call a list of public functions — called methods.

### 9.1.2 Abstraction

- **Data Abstraction** is a way of creating a simple model of a more complex real-world entities, which contains the only important properties from the perspective of the context of an application.

- **OOP Abstraction** is using abstract class/Interface we express the intent of the class rather than the actual implementation.

### 9.1.4 Inheritance

In OOP, the child class could reuse all method of parents class.(Except the private members in some advance language).

All child `is a` type of parents.
for example, car is type of vehicle, bird is type of animal, chicken is type of bird, etc.

### 9.1.3 Polymorphism

Polymorphism is mean each child class could have different behaver through inheritance same method from parents.

![Polymorphism](https://miro.medium.com/max/638/1*cFSJ95jyw-ACiWaIRxAbbg.jpeg)

```python
class Animal(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def talk(self):
        raise NotImplementedError


class Dog(Animal):
    def talk(self):
        return "Bow...Bow..."


class Cat(Animal):
    def talk(self):
        return "Meow...Meow..."


class Human(Animal):
    def talk(self):
        return "I can talk more...."
```

## 9.2 Example of OOP in Python

### 9.2.1 Animal example 1

Below example  show the Animal dog, and turtle class in OOP.

![example1](09.PythonOOP_example1.png)

```python
class Animal:

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name 
        print(self.name + " was adopted.")

    def run(self):
        print("running!")

class Dog(Animal):

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name 
        print(self.name + " was adopted.")

    def bark(self):
        print("woof!")

class Turtle(Animal):

    def __init__(self):
        super().init 

    def run(self):
        print("running slowly!")

# we don't care how it works just bark
spot = Dog("spot") #=> spot was adopted. 
spot.bark() #=> woof! 

# Dog inheritance the run method from animal
spot.run() #=> running! 

# we get back an interesting response 
tim = Turtle("tim") #=> tim was adopted. 
tim.run() #=> running slowly!

```

### 9.2.2 Animal example 2

Below show more complex example of Inheritance and Polymorphism.
![understand inheritance](https://stoneskin.github.io/SummerCamp_Python_Minecraft/inherit.png)

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self,name,gender):
        self.name=name
        self.gender=gender
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return "class={}: name:{} gender:{}".format(type(self).__name__,self.name,self.gender)

class Bird(Animal):
    def __init__(self,name,gender):
        Animal.__init__(self,name,gender)
    def flying(self):
        return "birds flying..."  

class Chicken(Bird):
    def __init__(self,name,gender):
        super().__init__(name,gender) #python 3 and upper you could use supper() to init parent without self
        self.gender=gender
    def flying(self):
        return "chicken {} can't fly..".format(self.name)

class CanadianGoose(Bird):
    def __init__(self,name,gender):
        Bird.__init__(self,name,gender)
    def swimming(self):
        return "Canadian Goose floating on the water.."

aHen = Chicken("egg hatcher","F")
aRooster = Chicken("big Foot","M")
aGoose = CanadianGoose("wild goose","unknown") 

print(aHen.flying())
print(aGoose.flying())
print(aGoose.swimming())
print(aRooster)

```

## 9.3 Home work

Please practice the OOP by write class `vehicle, Car, truck`.
