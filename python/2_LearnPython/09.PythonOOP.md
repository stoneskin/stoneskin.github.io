# 09 Python OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects.

## 9.1 4 Principles of OOP

There are 4 major principles that make a language Object-Oriented. These are Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism, and Inheritance. These are also called the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming.

![4 principles](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*GDZKZyaSfQGm8HL-CtYWtA.jpeg)

### 9.1.1 Encapsulation

Encapsulation is achieved when each object keeps its state private, inside a class. Other objects don’t have direct access to this state. Instead, they can only call a list of public functions — called methods.

### 9.1.2 Abstraction

- **Data Abstraction** is a way of creating a simple model of more complex real-world entities, which contains only the important properties from the perspective of the context of an application.

- **OOP Abstraction** uses abstract classes or interfaces to express the intent of the class rather than the actual implementation.

### 9.1.3 Inheritance

In OOP, the child class could reuse all method of parents class.(Except the private members in some advance language).

All child `is a` type of parents.
for example, car is type of vehicle, bird is type of animal, chicken is type of bird, etc.

### 9.1.4 Polymorphism

Polymorphism means each child class can have different behaviors through inheriting the same method from the parent class.

```python
class Animal(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def talk(self):
        raise NotImplementedError


class Dog(Animal):
    def talk(self):
        return "Bow...Bow..."


class Cat(Animal):
    def talk(self):
        return "Meow...Meow..."


class Human(Animal):
    def talk(self):
        return "I can talk more...."
```

## 9.2 Example of OOP in Python

### 9.2.1 Animal Example 1

The example below shows the Animal, Dog, and Turtle classes in OOP.

![example1](09.PythonOOP_example1.png)

```python
class Animal:

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name 
        print(self.name + " was adopted.")

    def run(self):
        print("running!")

class Dog(Animal):

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name 
        print(self.name + " was adopted.")

    def bark(self):
        print("woof!")

class Turtle(Animal):

    def __init__(self, name):
        super().__init__(name)

    def run(self):
        print("running slowly!")

# We don't care how it works, just bark
spot = Dog("spot") #=> spot was adopted. 
spot.bark() #=> woof! 

# Dog inherits the run method from Animal
spot.run() #=> running! 

# We get back an interesting response 
tim = Turtle("tim") #=> tim was adopted. 
tim.run() #=> running slowly!
```

### 9.2.2 Animal Example 2

Below is a more complex example of Inheritance and Polymorphism.
![understand inheritance](https://stoneskin.github.io/SummerCamp_Python_Minecraft/inherit.png)

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, gender):
        self.name = name
        self.gender = gender
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return "class={}: name:{} gender:{}".format(type(self).__name__, self.name, self.gender)

class Bird(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, gender):
        Animal.__init__(self, name, gender)
    def flying(self):
        return "birds flying..."  

class Chicken(Bird):
    def __init__(self, name, gender):
        super().__init__(name, gender) # In Python 3 and above, you can use super() to initialize the parent without self
        self.gender = gender
    def flying(self):
        return "chicken {} can't fly..".format(self.name)

class CanadianGoose(Bird):
    def __init__(self, name, gender):
        Bird.__init__(self, name, gender)
    def swimming(self):
        return "Canadian Goose floating on the water.."

aHen = Chicken("egg hatcher", "F")
aRooster = Chicken("big Foot", "M")
aGoose = CanadianGoose("wild goose", "unknown") 

print(aHen.flying())
print(aGoose.flying())
print(aGoose.swimming())
print(aRooster)
```

## 9.3 Homework

Please practice OOP by writing classes `Vehicle`, `Car`, and `Truck`.

### Recommendations

- **Examples**: Include more examples and exercises to help students understand each principle.
- **Interactive Learning**: Use interactive tools or platforms where students can write and test their code.
- **Visual Aids**: Use diagrams and flowcharts to explain concepts visually.
- **Real-World Applications**: Show how OOP principles are used in real-world applications to make learning more relevant.
- **Quizzes**: Add quizzes at the end of each section to reinforce learning.
