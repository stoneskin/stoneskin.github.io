![](learnPythonWithPygam.png)

## Description

Learn programming while having fun in building your own game!
Students will learn programming by writing Python code with PyGame Library: first learn some basic programming skills and then learn to use Python code to build multiple games in PyGame.
Session1: Python basics with Turtle
Session2: Get started with PyGame
Session3: Use PyGame to build your Own Game

### MLCCC Classroom Zoom Meeting rules

* Change your zoom user name to the real name same as you register the MLCCC classes.
* Keep your mic mute until The teacher or TA asking you to talk.

### Class Requirements

* Students need a computer that can install and run Python
* Students need to have some programming experience and be able to follow the rules in the game and the classroom.

### Recommended books (optional)
